             My teamwork with Isa really helped me gain skills during this course. Isa and I were able to 
             discuss major topics, and troubleshoot coding issues. As a beginner, it is sometimes difficult
             to know where to start. However, looking at eachothers code and searching the web, inspired us
             both to be better coders. There were times I was lost, but looking at Isa's code and trying to 
             adapt it to my own site really helped.
