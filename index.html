        <p class="lead">
          I am a geoscience, botany, and public service enthusiast...
          But I also want to learn coding to enhance my skillset.
          I am learning to code during my B.A. degree in Multidisciplinary Studies.
          Outside of school and work, I love to read, hike with my dog, kayak, and travel.
          I am based in Seattle, WA.

<h3 style="text-align:center";font-size:40px;>About this Site</h3>

<p>
This is a project is a part of a course in The College of Innovation and Design at Boise State University. When I enrolled in online courses with BSU I had already studied for years in the sciences. 
Until I enrolled in this course I had done a little bit of geospatial modelling and data management but this is my first time designing my own web page.
