<p>
This is a project is a part of a course in Boise States College of Innovation and Design. When I enrolled in on-line courses with BSU I had already study for years in the sciences. 
Until I enrolled in this course I had done a little bit of geospatial modelling, data managment but I'd never used code to design my own web page.
