<p>
This is a project is a part of a course in The College of Innovation and Design at Boise State University. When I enrolled in online courses with BSU I had already studied for years in the sciences. 
Until I enrolled in this course I had done a little bit of geospatial modelling and data management but this is my first time designing my own web page.
